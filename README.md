# Verde: Decentralized Academic Credential Verification

> **FSDET17 Submission**

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Verde** is a pioneering blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize how academic credentials and student grades are stored, verified, and shared. By leveraging **Smart Contracts** and **Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)**, Verde ensures that educational records are immutable, transparent, and instantly verifiable by third parties (employers, other institutions).

This repository serves as the formal submission for **FSDET17**, showcasing the integration of full-stack development principles with blockchain architecture.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Immutable Record Keeping**: Student grades and degrees are recorded on the blockchain, preventing tampering or fraud.
- **Instant Verification**: Employers can verify a candidate's credentials in real-time without administrative bureaucratic delays.
- **UoM Token Integration**: Utilizes a custom utility token (`UomToken`) for ecosystem interactions and governance.
- **Smart Contract Logic**: Automated logic for grade submission and degree issuance using Solidity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills

This project demonstrates proficiency in the following technologies:

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum / EVM-compatible networks
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity (`StudentGrades.sol`, `UomToken.sol`)
- **Backend**: Node.js (implied for interfacing)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive architectural analysis (see PDF)

## 💡 Innovation

The traditional academic verification process is slow, paper-heavy, and prone to fraud. **Verde** solves this by establishing a "Trustless" environment where the validity of a degree is guaranteed by cryptographic proof rather than a central authority's manual confirmation.

## 📄 Documentation
